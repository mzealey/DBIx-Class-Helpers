## DDL

To Generate ddl.sql which will allow you to run prove -lr use the following command:
perl -Ilib -It/lib -MTestSchema -E'TestSchema->generate_ddl; my $t = TestSchema->connect; $t->deploy'

Eventually that will be migrated into it's own Dzil plugin, but for now that should work

## Testing

To run tests against all major supported databases use:

```
$ maint/dockerprove -lr t
```

You can set DBIITEST_STARTUP to 10 or 15 to wait longer for the databases to be
ready to test against.  Default is 5s.

## Releasing

```
$ maint/release
```
